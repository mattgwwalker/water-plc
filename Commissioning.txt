Water RO Commissioning
======================

Connect to the PLC at 192.168.0.1.

Using the Texmate Development System, compile water.bas and open the
port to the PLC.


To confirm communication:
-------------------------
 - ensure that compressed air is connected
 - add User/UserVariables/SV05cmd to the watch window
 - turn the watch on
 - the value should read zero
 - double click on the value
 - set the value to 3 and press enter
 - double click on the value and set it to 2
 - finally double click on the value and set it to 1
 - ensure that the valve SV05 changed state at least once


To modify the state of a valve:
-------------------------------
 - ensure that the plant is in the stopped state (fd100StepNumber == 0)
 - the cmd variable (for example, SV05cmd) sets the valve to one of three
   states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On
 - add the cmd variable to the watch window (find the variable under
   User/UserVariables)
 - turn the watch on
 - double click on the variable in the watch window
 - type the new value and press enter
 
Note that the valves require air pressure to function, and the system
NO LONGER checks that there is sufficient, or even any, air pressure.
Further, note that the valve may already be in the desired state.  To
check that it is working change the state from off to on and then to
auto.  If everything is working correctly, this should change the
valve position and then return it back again to its original position.


Check list of valves:
---------------------

Confirmation that a valve is working can be obtained by changing its
cmd variable to 3, then to 2, then to 1.  If the valve is working, it
will change state either two or three times, depending on its default
state.

The following valves exist, and should be confirmed as working for
commissioning:

SV02 - Supply water isolation valve (3:open, 2:closed)
SV03 - Permeate to tank isolation valve (3:open, 2:closed)
SV04 - Permeate out isolation valv (3:open, 2:closed)
SV05 - Permeate to retentate isolation valve (3:open, 2:closed)
SV06 - Double block? (3: open, 2:closed)
SV08 - Permeate to PP03 isolation valve (3: open, 2: closed)



Switches and Lights:
--------------------

There are three switches and one light.

There is no emergency stop.






Level Transmitters:
-------------------

There is one tank on RO4, the feedtank.  The tank has a level
transmitter, LT01.

There is another possibility for an off-rig feedtank.  This would have
another transmitter, LT02, which would need to be plugged into a
socket underneath the control cabinet.





Pumps:
------

The VSD is not configured to run the pump at a minimum speed.  Neither
does it ramp speed changes slowly.

Pump 1 (PP01) takes product from the feed tank and "stuffs" it into the
retentate line.

Pump 2 (PP02) pumps the retentate through the membranes.

To run a pump, there is both a run signal and a run speed.  The signal
variable ends in 'cmd' (for example, 'PP01cmd') and the speed variable
ends with an '_SPD' (for example, 'PP01_SPD').

The speed variable is a percentage multiplied by 100.  So to set the
speed to 50%, set the variable to 50x100 = 5000.

The VSDs do not appear to ramp the pump speed slowly to ensure that
the pumps are not shoked by a request.  Thus, they hit their speed
point very quickly and should not be asked to go from say 0% to 100%,
or visa versa.


For pump 1, the VSD ensure a safe minimum run speed for the pump, thus
setting the speed to 0% does not stop the pump, but rather runs it as
slowly as possible in a manner that can be maintained without over
heating the pumps.


{ CHECK ME:
This is not the case for pump 2.
}


To run and to stop the pump, use the command variable.  Set the
command variable to one of three states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On

Make sure there is liquid in the feed tank or in the retentate line
before starting a pump as the pumps do not appreciate being run dry.





Flow meters:
------------

There are three flow meters, FT01, FT02, and FT03.  Their values can be
displayed on the LCD screen (press the down arrow until the appropriate
page is shown).

FT01 measures the permeate flow in L/h.  If the plant is configured
with just one membrane, it's possible that the permeate flow is so low
that this flow meter is unreliable.

FT02 measures the flow in the bypass line in L/h.

FT03 measures the retentate flow rate in L/h.




Pressure transmitters and switches:
-----------------------------------

There are three pressure transmitters, PT01, PT02, and PT05.  PT01 and
PT02 are displayed on the LCD screen.  PS04 is a pressure switch.

PT01 measures the pressure in the retentate circulation flow after the pump PP01.

PT02 measures the pressure downstream of the membranes.

PS04 is a pressure switch for the seal water on pump PP02.

PT05 measures the permeate pressure.




Temperature transmitter:
------------------------

There is one temperature transmitter, TT01.  It measures the
temperature of the retentate line (just after the pressure pump PP02).

{ CHECK ME:
When not stopped, there is a constant check on the temperature to
ensure the safety of the membrane.
}



PID control:
------------

There are a number of PID controllers.  They have an interface similar
to valves and pumps.

To change the state of the controller, use the command variable (cmd).  Set the
command variable to one of three states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual setpoint
     3 -> Manual PID

Manual setpoint allows you to write to the cv variable (e.g. PC01cv),
which is always copied to the control variable (PP01_SPD).  So, to
manually set the value of PP01_SPD to 30%, set the PID controller cmd
variable to 2, and change PC01cv to 3000.




Commissioning notes:
--------------------

2017-10-27:

Ran plant on bore water.  Raw water measured ~185 us/cm.  RO water
measured ~6 us/cm.  Produced around 800--900 L/hour
of permeate at 15 bar.


2017-10-06:

Changed fault light so that it is illuminated when the conductivity of
the RO water is not passing the threshold.


2017-09-07:

Fault light working.

PP02 run command working.  Tested on water, which ran from the small
tank through to the non return valve before the injection point.  It
wasn't able to be confirmed that water flowed through the injection
point, but it probably does.


2017-09-01:

All automated valves tested as operational.  PP03 run up to 80% speed.
Plant can be controlled manually and produced 700l/h of permeate.
